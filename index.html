            <div class="section-body">In the last 24 hours, global crude markets exhibited a firmer tone, driven primarily by geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions. Brent crude and WTI prices diverged, with Brent showing stronger gains compared to WTI, reflecting heightened concerns over supply disruptions.

Additionally, OPEC+ discussions regarding production levels contributed to market sentiment, with some member countries signaling potential adjustments to output strategies. This has further reinforced the upward momentum in Brent, while WTI's performance remained comparatively subdued, highlighting the ongoing divergence between the two benchmarks.</div>

            <div class="section-body">Over the last 24 hours, the physical market has exhibited tightening conditions, driven by a combination of declining inventories and ongoing OPEC+ discipline that continues to support higher prices. The recent draw in crude stockpiles has reinforced bullish sentiment, while refining margins remain robust, indicating strong demand for refined products. Despite this tightening backdrop, there has been some divergence in benchmark prices, with certain regional markets experiencing upward pressure while others lag behind, reflecting localized supply and demand dynamics.

            <div class="section-body">**Supply & Operations**

The most significant supply-side constraint affecting physical barrels today is the ongoing disruptions in upstream production in the North Sea region. Maintenance activities and unplanned outages at key oil fields have led to a reduction in output, tightening the availability of crude oil in the market. This situation is compounded by geopolitical tensions that have raised concerns about the stability of supply from the region. As a result, the reduced upstream capacity is impacting overall crude availability, influencing pricing dynamics and operational strategies for downstream refiners.</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Demand & Products**

Today’s market tone is primarily influenced by gasoline demand signals. Recent data indicates a notable increase in gasoline consumption, driven by higher mobility rates and a resurgence in travel-related activities. This uptick in demand has resulted in tighter supply conditions, contributing to upward pressure on gasoline prices.

In contrast, diesel demand remains relatively stable but does not exhibit the same level of momentum as gasoline. Jet fuel demand is also showing signs of recovery, but it is not sufficient to counterbalance the dominant bullish sentiment surrounding gasoline. Overall, the gasoline market is the key driver of today’s market dynamics.</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Regulatory & Geopolitical**

1. **U.S. Sanctions on Iranian Oil Exports**: The U.S. Treasury Department has announced new sanctions targeting entities involved in the sale of Iranian oil. This development could lead to a tightening of global oil supply as Iranian barrels may face increased difficulties in reaching international markets. As a result, prices could experience upward pressure due to reduced availability of crude oil, particularly if buyers become more cautious about engaging with Iranian suppliers.

2. **OPEC+ Production Adjustments**: Reports indicate that OPEC+ members are discussing potential adjustments to their production quotas in response to fluctuating demand signals. If agreed upon, these adjustments could influence the flow of crude oil into the market, potentially tightening supply and impacting pricing dynamics. A reduction in output could lead to higher prices, while an increase could alleviate some upward pressure, depending on the scale of the changes.

3. **Political Unrest in Nigeria**: Ongoing political unrest in Nigeria has led to disruptions in oil production in key regions. As Nigeria is one of Africa's largest oil producers, any significant decline in output could reduce the flow of crude oil to global markets. This situation may create a risk of supply shortages, which could drive prices higher as buyers seek alternative sources to compensate for lost Nigerian barrels.</div>

            <div class="section-title">Key Decisions & Watchpoints</div>
            <div class="section-body">If geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions persist, then supply disruptions may lead to increased volatility in crude oil prices. If refining capacity constraints continue, then product shortages could result in higher gasoline and diesel prices at the pump. If OPEC+ maintains its current production levels, then global inventory levels may remain tight, potentially supporting higher market prices.</div>
