            <div class="section-body">In the last 24 hours, global crude markets exhibited firmer sentiment, driven by ongoing geopolitical tensions and supply chain concerns. Brent crude and WTI benchmarks showed divergent movements, with Brent gaining strength while WTI remained relatively stable. This divergence reflects regional supply dynamics and differing market responses to inventory reports.

Additionally, OPEC+ discussions regarding production levels have contributed to the overall market firmness, as member nations signal a commitment to manage output effectively. Meanwhile, U.S. inventory data released yesterday indicated a slight draw, further supporting the bullish tone in Brent prices.</div>

            <div class="section-title">Market Signal</div>
            <div class="section-body">Over the last 24 hours, the physical market has exhibited tightening conditions, driven by a notable draw in inventories alongside sustained OPEC+ discipline in production levels, which has reinforced bullish sentiment. Price action reflects this tightening, as crude benchmarks have shown upward momentum, despite some divergence in refined product margins, which remain under pressure due to fluctuating demand dynamics. This combination of inventory reductions and adherence to production targets by OPEC+ has contributed to a more constrained supply outlook, further supporting the upward trajectory in crude prices.

The most significant supply-side constraint currently affecting physical barrels is the ongoing underinvestment in upstream oil production capacity. Despite recent increases in oil prices, many producers are hesitant to ramp up drilling activities due to lingering uncertainties surrounding demand and regulatory pressures. This has resulted in a slower-than-anticipated recovery in production levels, particularly in key regions such as the U.S. shale plays and OPEC+ member countries. As a consequence, the inability to swiftly increase output is limiting the availability of physical barrels in the market, contributing to tighter supply conditions.</div>

Today’s market tone is primarily influenced by gasoline margins, which have shown a notable increase due to rising demand amid tighter supply conditions. Gasoline inventories have been reported lower than the five-year average, contributing to upward pressure on prices. 

In contrast, diesel margins are experiencing a slight decline, as recent data indicates an increase in inventory levels, which may temper overall bullish sentiment in the broader petroleum market. Jet fuel demand remains stable, but it is not exerting significant influence on the market tone today. Overall, gasoline margins are the key driver shaping today's market dynamics.</div>

1. **US Sanctions on Iranian Oil Exports**: The U.S. Treasury Department has announced new sanctions targeting Iranian oil exports, specifically targeting entities involved in facilitating these shipments. This development could restrict the flow of Iranian crude to global markets, potentially tightening supply and exerting upward pressure on prices, especially if compliance with these sanctions is widely adopted by international buyers.

2. **OPEC+ Production Adjustments**: Reports indicate that OPEC+ member states are considering further production adjustments in response to fluctuating global demand. Any decision to cut or maintain production levels could directly impact the availability of barrels in the market, influencing pricing dynamics. A reduction in output could lead to increased prices due to perceived scarcity, while an increase could have the opposite effect.

3. **Russia-Ukraine Conflict Escalation**: Recent military escalations in the Russia-Ukraine conflict have raised concerns about the security of energy supplies from the region. This situation could lead to disruptions in oil flows, particularly from Eastern Europe, which may result in increased volatility in pricing as markets react to potential supply chain interruptions.</div>

            <div class="section-title">Key Decisions & Watchpoints</div>
            <div class="section-body">If geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions persist, then supply disruptions may lead to increased volatility in crude oil prices. If refinery utilization rates remain low due to maintenance activities, then product inventories could build, potentially exerting downward pressure on gasoline prices. If global demand for petroleum products continues to show signs of weakness, then investment in upstream projects may decline further, impacting future supply capabilities.</div>
