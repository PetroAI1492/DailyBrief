            <div class="section-title">Executive Snapshot</div>
            <div class="section-body">In the last 24 hours, global crude markets exhibited a firmer tone, driven by geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions. Brent and WTI benchmarks showed divergent movements, with Brent prices gaining traction while WTI remained relatively stable. This divergence reflects varying market sentiments influenced by regional supply concerns and inventory fluctuations.

Additionally, OPEC+ discussions surrounding production levels have contributed to the overall firmness in sentiment, as member states signal a commitment to managing output effectively. Meanwhile, U.S. inventory data released yesterday indicated a slight draw, further supporting the upward momentum in Brent prices.</div>

            <div class="section-title">Market Signal</div>
            <div class="section-body">Over the last 24 hours, the physical market has exhibited tightening conditions, driven by a combination of declining inventories and sustained OPEC+ discipline in production levels. Despite fluctuations in benchmark prices, the overall market sentiment reflects a tightening supply-demand balance, as refiners continue to operate at high margins, indicating robust demand for crude. This tightening is further underscored by the recent drawdowns in stock levels, which have not been fully offset by any significant increases in production from non-OPEC sources. While some benchmarks have shown divergence, the underlying structural signals point towards a more constrained market environment. [TIGHTENING]</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Supply & Operations**

The most significant supply-side constraint affecting physical barrels today is the ongoing operational disruptions in upstream production due to geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions. Specifically, heightened security concerns and intermittent production outages in parts of the Middle East have led to reduced output levels. This situation is exacerbated by logistical challenges in transporting crude to refineries, resulting in tighter supply conditions in the market. As a result, the ability to meet current demand is increasingly strained, impacting overall market dynamics.</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Demand & Products**

Today, the market tone is primarily influenced by gasoline demand, which has shown resilience amid fluctuating crude prices. Recent data indicates a steady consumption pattern, supported by robust driving activity and limited inventory levels. This sustained demand for gasoline is contributing to upward pressure on prices.

In contrast, diesel demand appears to be softer, with recent reports highlighting a decline in consumption due to reduced activity in certain industrial sectors. This divergence between gasoline and diesel is noteworthy, as it underscores the current market dynamics where gasoline remains the focal point of strength, while diesel faces headwinds. Jet fuel demand remains stable, but it is not exerting significant influence on the overall market tone today.</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Regulatory & Geopolitical**

1. **U.S. Sanctions on Iranian Oil Exports**: The U.S. Treasury Department has announced new sanctions targeting Iranian oil exports, specifically aimed at entities facilitating the sale of Iranian crude. This move is expected to tighten global supply further by restricting Iranian barrels from entering the market, potentially leading to upward pressure on prices as buyers seek alternative sources.

2. **OPEC+ Production Discussions**: Reports indicate that OPEC+ is in preliminary discussions regarding potential adjustments to production quotas in response to fluctuating global demand. Any shifts in production levels could directly impact oil flows, with a reduction in output likely leading to tighter market conditions and increased pricing volatility.

3. **Political Unrest in Libya**: Renewed political unrest in Libya has led to the temporary shutdown of several oil fields and export terminals. This disruption could reduce the volume of Libyan crude available on the market, exacerbating supply constraints and potentially pushing prices higher as buyers compete for limited alternatives.</div>

            <div class="section-body">If global crude oil inventories continue to decline, then upward pressure on prices may intensify. If geopolitical tensions in oil-producing regions escalate, then supply disruptions could become more likely. If refinery utilization rates remain high, then product availability may tighten, potentially leading to increased retail fuel prices.</div>
