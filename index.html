            <div class="section-title">Executive Snapshot</div>
            <div class="section-body">In the last 24 hours, global crude markets exhibited a firmer tone, driven by renewed geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions. This uptick in sentiment was reflected in the pricing dynamics of major benchmarks, with Brent crude showing a notable increase compared to WTI, which remained relatively stable. 

The divergence between Brent and WTI highlights a growing premium for Brent, attributed to supply concerns and ongoing discussions around production cuts among OPEC+ members. Meanwhile, U.S. crude inventories reported a slight increase, contributing to a softer outlook for domestic prices, despite the overall bullish sentiment in the international market.</div>

            <div class="section-body">Over the last 24 hours, the physical market has exhibited tightening conditions, driven by a combination of declining inventories and robust demand signals, which have supported upward price momentum. OPEC+ compliance remains strong, contributing to a disciplined supply environment that has further tightened the market. While crude benchmarks have shown some divergence, with certain grades experiencing more pronounced gains due to localized supply constraints, the overall sentiment reflects a tightening landscape.

            <div class="section-body">**Supply & Operations**

The most significant supply-side constraint affecting physical barrels today is the ongoing maintenance and operational disruptions in upstream production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Several key operators are currently conducting scheduled maintenance on offshore platforms, which has resulted in a temporary reduction in crude oil output. This maintenance is critical for ensuring the long-term efficiency and safety of production operations but is contributing to tighter supply conditions in the near term. The impact of these disruptions is being closely monitored, as they may influence the availability of crude oil in the market.</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Demand & Products**

Today’s market tone is primarily influenced by the gasoline crack spread, which has shown notable strength amid rising demand for gasoline in several key regions. This uptick in gasoline margins reflects increased consumption patterns, likely driven by higher travel activity and a rebound in economic activity.

In contrast, diesel margins have softened slightly, indicating a divergence in demand dynamics between the two fuels. Jet fuel remains stable, with no significant shifts observed that would counteract the prevailing strength in gasoline. Overall, the gasoline crack spread is the dominant signal today, highlighting a robust demand environment for this product.</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Regulatory & Geopolitical**

1. **U.S. Sanctions on Iranian Oil Exports**: The U.S. Treasury Department has announced new sanctions targeting Iranian oil exports, specifically targeting entities involved in the sale and transportation of Iranian crude. This development could tighten global oil supply as it may deter buyers from engaging with Iranian crude, potentially leading to upward pressure on prices for alternative sources of oil. Additionally, the sanctions could disrupt existing flows, as companies reassess their exposure to Iranian oil.

2. **OPEC+ Production Adjustments**: OPEC+ has convened to discuss potential adjustments to production quotas in response to recent price fluctuations. Any decision to cut or increase production could significantly impact oil flows and pricing. A reduction in output could lead to a tightening of supply in the market, driving prices higher, while an increase could alleviate some upward pressure but may also lead to concerns over oversupply.

3. **Political Unrest in Venezuela**: Reports indicate escalating political unrest in Venezuela, with protests against the government intensifying. This situation raises concerns about the stability of oil production in the country, which has already been struggling with output levels. Any disruptions to Venezuelan oil production could further constrain global supply, potentially leading to increased prices as markets react to the uncertainty surrounding Venezuelan crude flows.</div>

            <div class="section-title">Key Decisions & Watchpoints</div>
            <div class="section-body">If geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions persist, then supply disruptions may lead to increased volatility in crude oil prices. If OPEC+ maintains its current production levels, then global inventory levels could tighten further, potentially supporting higher prices. If refining margins continue to weaken, then downstream operations may face profitability challenges, influencing market dynamics.</div>
