            <div class="section-body">In the last 24 hours, global crude markets exhibited a firmer tone, driven by ongoing geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions. Brent crude and WTI benchmarks showed divergent movements, with Brent experiencing a more pronounced increase compared to WTI, reflecting heightened concerns over supply disruptions.

Additionally, the latest inventory reports indicated a draw in U.S. crude stockpiles, further supporting the upward momentum in prices. Meanwhile, market participants remain attentive to potential shifts in OPEC+ production strategies, which could influence future market dynamics.</div>

            <div class="section-body">Over the last 24 hours, the physical market has exhibited tightening conditions, driven by a combination of declining inventories and sustained OPEC+ discipline in production levels, which has supported upward price movements across various crude benchmarks. Margins remain robust, indicating strong refining activity, while the divergence between WTI and Brent prices reflects regional supply dynamics and differing demand signals. Overall, the tightening market environment is underscored by these structural signals, reinforcing the upward pressure on prices. [TIGHTENING]</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Supply & Operations**

The most pressing supply-side constraint currently affecting physical barrels is the ongoing operational disruptions in upstream production in the Gulf of Mexico. Recent weather-related incidents have led to temporary shutdowns and reduced output from several key offshore platforms. This has resulted in a notable decrease in crude oil supply, impacting overall availability in the market. Operators are working to restore production levels, but the immediate effects of these disruptions are being felt in both domestic and international markets, tightening supply and potentially influencing pricing dynamics.</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Demand & Products**

Today’s market tone is primarily influenced by gasoline demand. Recent reports indicate a notable increase in gasoline consumption, driven by higher travel activity and a rebound in consumer mobility. This uptick has contributed to tightening inventories, further supporting gasoline prices.

In contrast, diesel demand remains relatively stable, with no significant shifts observed that would counteract the bullish sentiment surrounding gasoline. Jet fuel demand also shows resilience, but it is not currently impacting the overall market tone as significantly as gasoline. Overall, the strength in gasoline is the key driver of today’s market dynamics.</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Regulatory & Geopolitical**

1. **U.S. Sanctions on Iranian Oil Exports**: The U.S. Treasury Department announced new sanctions targeting entities involved in facilitating Iranian oil exports. This development could restrict the flow of Iranian crude to international markets, potentially tightening supply and exerting upward pressure on global oil prices. Traders may react by adjusting their positions, anticipating reduced availability of Iranian barrels.

2. **OPEC+ Meeting Outcomes**: Following a recent OPEC+ meeting, member countries reaffirmed their commitment to existing production cuts. This decision signals a continued effort to manage supply levels in response to fluctuating demand. As a result, the stability of oil prices may be influenced, with market participants closely monitoring compliance levels among member states, which could affect physical flows depending on adherence to the agreed quotas.

3. **Political Unrest in Nigeria**: Reports of escalating political unrest in Nigeria have emerged, raising concerns over potential disruptions to oil production in the region. As one of Africa's largest oil producers, any significant interruption could lead to a decrease in output, impacting global supply chains. This situation may prompt market participants to hedge against potential supply shortages, thereby influencing pricing dynamics in the short term.</div>

            <div class="section-title">Key Decisions & Watchpoints</div>
            <div class="section-body">If geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions persist, then supply disruptions may lead to increased volatility in crude oil prices. If refinery utilization rates remain low, then product inventories could build, potentially exerting downward pressure on gasoline and diesel prices. If global demand for petroleum products continues to recover, then competition for available supplies may intensify, impacting pricing dynamics across markets.</div>
