            <div class="section-body">In the last 24 hours, global crude markets exhibited a firmer tone, primarily driven by ongoing geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions. Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmarks showed notable divergence, with Brent gaining more traction compared to WTI, reflecting heightened concerns over supply disruptions.

Additionally, market sentiment was influenced by recent inventory reports indicating tighter supply conditions in the U.S., further supporting the upward momentum in Brent prices. Meanwhile, WTI's performance was tempered by rising production levels domestically, leading to a more subdued response in that benchmark.</div>

            <div class="section-body">Over the last 24 hours, the physical market has exhibited tightening conditions, driven by a combination of declining inventory levels and sustained OPEC+ discipline in production cuts, which has supported higher prices across various benchmarks. Despite some divergence between WTI and Brent, with WTI showing relatively stronger performance, the overall market sentiment remains bullish as refining margins have improved, indicating robust demand for refined products. This tightening scenario is further reinforced by ongoing geopolitical tensions that continue to impact supply dynamics. [TIGHTENING]</div>

The most significant supply-side constraint currently affecting physical barrels is the ongoing underinvestment in upstream oil production capacity. Despite recent price fluctuations, many major oil producers have maintained a cautious approach to expanding output, primarily due to lingering uncertainties around demand recovery and geopolitical tensions. This restraint in capital expenditure has resulted in slower-than-anticipated production increases, particularly in key regions such as the U.S. shale plays and OPEC+ member countries. As a result, the ability to respond to any sudden spikes in demand remains limited, impacting overall market liquidity and availability of physical barrels.</div>

Today's market tone is primarily influenced by gasoline demand, which has shown a notable increase as consumers continue to engage in travel and leisure activities. This uptick in gasoline consumption is supported by lower retail prices, encouraging higher utilization rates at the pump.

In contrast, diesel demand remains relatively stable but does not exhibit the same upward momentum as gasoline. Jet fuel demand is also steady, reflecting ongoing recovery in air travel, yet it does not significantly counterbalance the bullish sentiment driven by gasoline. Overall, gasoline is the dominant product signal today, shaping the market outlook.</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Regulatory & Geopolitical**

1. **U.S. Sanctions on Iranian Oil Exports**: The U.S. Treasury Department has announced new sanctions targeting entities involved in the sale of Iranian oil. This move is expected to tighten the already limited flow of Iranian crude to international markets, potentially leading to increased prices for alternative suppliers as buyers seek to replace lost barrels. The sanctions could also heighten tensions in the Middle East, impacting shipping routes and further influencing oil pricing volatility.

2. **OPEC+ Production Discussions**: Reports indicate that OPEC+ members are convening to discuss potential adjustments to their production quotas in response to current market conditions. Any decision to alter output levels could directly affect global oil supply, influencing pricing dynamics. A reduction in production could tighten the market, leading to upward pressure on prices, while an increase might alleviate some supply constraints but could also signal a lack of confidence in demand.

3. **Political Unrest in Venezuela**: Recent protests in Venezuela have escalated, raising concerns about the stability of the country's oil production. As one of the largest oil reserves holders, any disruption in Venezuelan output could lead to a decrease in available barrels on the market, potentially driving prices higher. The situation remains fluid, and further developments could significantly impact both the physical flow of oil and market sentiment.</div>

            <div class="section-title">Key Decisions & Watchpoints</div>
            <div class="section-body">If geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions persist, then supply disruptions may lead to increased volatility in crude oil prices. If refinery utilization rates remain below historical averages, then refined product inventories could tighten, potentially driving up gasoline and diesel prices. If global demand for oil continues to recover, then competition for available supply may intensify, impacting market dynamics.</div>
