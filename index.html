            <div class="section-body">In the last 24 hours, global crude markets exhibited a firmer tone, driven by a combination of geopolitical tensions and supply chain concerns. Notably, Brent crude and WTI benchmarks displayed divergent movements, with Brent showing stronger gains compared to WTI, reflecting varying regional demand dynamics and inventory levels.

Additionally, OPEC+ discussions regarding production adjustments have contributed to the market's upward momentum, as member countries signal a commitment to manage output effectively. Meanwhile, U.S. inventory reports indicated a slight draw, further supporting the bullish sentiment in the market.</div>

            <div class="section-body">Over the last 24 hours, the physical market has shown signs of tightening, driven by a combination of declining inventory levels and ongoing adherence to production cuts by OPEC+, which has reinforced upward pressure on prices. Margins for refiners have remained robust, indicating strong demand for refined products, which further supports the tightening narrative. While there has been some divergence in benchmark prices, with certain grades experiencing more significant gains than others, the overall sentiment remains bullish as market participants respond to the tightening fundamentals.

            <div class="section-body">**Supply & Operations**

The most significant supply-side constraint currently affecting physical barrels is the ongoing maintenance activities in the North Sea region, particularly impacting upstream operations. Several key oil fields are undergoing scheduled maintenance, leading to reduced production levels. This has resulted in a noticeable decrease in available crude oil supply from this critical area, which is traditionally a major contributor to global markets. The maintenance work is expected to limit output in the near term, creating tighter supply conditions as demand remains steady.</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Demand & Products**

Today’s market tone is primarily influenced by gasoline demand, which has shown a notable increase in recent weeks. This uptick is attributed to higher consumer travel and activity levels, contributing to a tightening supply situation. As a result, gasoline margins have strengthened, reflecting the robust demand dynamics.

In contrast, diesel demand remains relatively stable but has not experienced the same upward momentum as gasoline. Jet fuel demand is also steady, yet it does not counteract the prevailing strength in gasoline. Overall, gasoline is the dominant signal driving today’s market sentiment.</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Regulatory & Geopolitical**

1. **U.S. Sanctions on Iranian Oil Exports**: The U.S. Treasury Department has announced new sanctions targeting Iranian oil exports, specifically aimed at entities involved in facilitating the sale of Iranian crude. This development could tighten global oil supply as Iranian barrels may face increased difficulties in reaching international markets, potentially leading to upward pressure on prices as buyers seek alternatives.

2. **OPEC+ Production Discussions**: Reports indicate that OPEC+ members are convening to discuss potential adjustments to production quotas in response to fluctuating global demand. Any decision to cut production could reduce available barrels in the market, impacting pricing dynamics and potentially leading to increased volatility as traders react to the outcomes of these discussions.

3. **Political Unrest in Nigeria**: Ongoing protests in Nigeria have escalated, with reports of disruptions to oil production facilities in the Niger Delta region. This unrest poses a risk to the flow of Nigerian crude, which could lead to supply shortages in the market. Any significant disruptions could result in a spike in prices as traders factor in the potential loss of Nigerian oil exports.</div>

            <div class="section-title">Key Decisions & Watchpoints</div>
            <div class="section-body">If geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions persist, then supply disruptions may lead to increased volatility in crude oil prices. If refinery utilization rates remain low due to maintenance schedules, then refined product inventories may build, potentially exerting downward pressure on gasoline prices. If OPEC+ continues to adhere to production cuts, then global oil market balance may tighten, supporting higher price levels in the medium term.</div>
