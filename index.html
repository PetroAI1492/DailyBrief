            <div class="section-body">In the last 24 hours, global crude markets exhibited a firmer tone, driven primarily by supply concerns stemming from ongoing geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions. Brent crude and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) benchmarks showed divergent movements, with Brent gaining strength while WTI remained relatively stable, reflecting varying market sentiments and regional supply dynamics.

Additionally, inventory reports indicated a draw in U.S. crude stockpiles, further supporting the upward momentum in Brent prices. The overall market sentiment remains cautious as traders assess potential impacts from both geopolitical developments and economic indicators.</div>

            <div class="section-body">Over the last 24 hours, the physical market has exhibited tightening conditions, driven by a combination of declining inventories and robust refining margins, which have supported higher demand for crude inputs. OPEC+ adherence to production cuts remains strong, further constraining supply in the face of steady consumption patterns. While benchmark crude prices have shown some divergence, with certain grades experiencing more pronounced gains than others, the overall sentiment reflects a tightening landscape as market participants respond to the ongoing supply constraints.

            <div class="section-body">**Supply & Operations**

The most significant supply-side constraint currently affecting physical barrels is the ongoing operational disruptions in the upstream sector due to geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions. Specifically, production levels in certain areas have been impacted by heightened security concerns and logistical challenges, leading to reduced output. This situation has created a tighter supply environment, as existing production capacities are unable to meet the demand for physical barrels, thereby straining the overall market dynamics.</div>

            <div class="section-title">Demand & Products</div>
            <div class="section-body">**Demand & Products**

Today’s market tone is primarily influenced by gasoline demand, which remains robust amid ongoing consumer activity. Gasoline inventories have shown a slight draw, indicating stronger-than-expected consumption levels. This trend is supported by recent data reflecting increased travel and mobility, contributing to heightened demand for gasoline.

In contrast, diesel demand appears to be lagging, with inventory levels remaining relatively stable. This divergence in product demand highlights the current market focus on gasoline, overshadowing any potential weakness in the diesel sector. Jet fuel demand is also stable, but it does not exert the same influence on the overall market tone as gasoline does today. 

Overall, gasoline stands out as the key driver in today’s market sentiment, reinforcing a positive outlook for this product amid contrasting signals from diesel.</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Regulatory & Geopolitical**

1. **U.S. Sanctions on Iranian Oil Exports**: The U.S. Treasury Department has announced new sanctions targeting entities involved in the sale of Iranian oil. This move is expected to further restrict Iran's ability to export crude, potentially tightening global supply. As a result, prices may experience upward pressure due to reduced availability of Iranian barrels in the market, impacting flows particularly in Asia where Iranian crude has been a significant source.

2. **OPEC+ Production Adjustments**: OPEC+ has convened to discuss potential adjustments to production quotas amid fluctuating global demand. Any decision to cut production could lead to a decrease in available barrels, which would likely support higher prices in the short term. Conversely, an increase in production could lead to oversupply concerns, affecting pricing dynamics in the physical oil markets.

3. **Political Unrest in Nigeria**: Reports of escalating violence and protests in Nigeria, a key oil-producing nation, have raised concerns about the stability of oil production in the region. Disruptions to operations in the Niger Delta could lead to a decrease in crude output, impacting global supply chains. This situation may result in increased premiums for Nigerian crude, influencing pricing and availability in the broader market.</div>

            <div class="section-title">Key Decisions & Watchpoints</div>
            <div class="section-body">If geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions persist, then supply disruptions may lead to increased crude prices. If refinery utilization rates remain low, then product inventories could build, potentially exerting downward pressure on refined product margins. If demand recovery in major economies falters, then the overall market sentiment may shift towards bearishness, impacting investment flows into the sector.</div>
