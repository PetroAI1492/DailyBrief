            <div class="section-body">In the last 24 hours, global crude markets exhibited a firmer tone, driven by ongoing geopolitical tensions and supply concerns. Brent crude and WTI benchmarks displayed notable divergence, with Brent gaining strength relative to WTI, reflecting heightened concerns over supply disruptions in key regions.

Additionally, market sentiment was influenced by recent inventory reports indicating tighter supply conditions in the U.S., further supporting the upward momentum in Brent prices. Conversely, WTI faced pressure from rising production levels, contributing to its relative softness against Brent.</div>

            <div class="section-title">Market Signal</div>
            <div class="section-body">Over the last 24 hours, the physical market has exhibited tightening conditions, driven by a combination of declining inventories and sustained OPEC+ discipline, which has reinforced upward pressure on prices. Despite some fluctuations in benchmark crude prices, the overall sentiment reflects a market responding to lower supply levels and robust demand signals, particularly in key regions. Margins for refiners have remained healthy, suggesting that the downstream sector is capitalizing on the current market dynamics. Notably, while WTI and Brent benchmarks have shown some divergence, the underlying structural signals indicate a consensus towards tighter market conditions. [TIGHTENING]</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Supply & Operations**

The most significant supply-side constraint currently affecting physical barrels is the ongoing operational disruptions in upstream production due to geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions. Specifically, heightened security concerns and intermittent conflicts in areas such as the Middle East have led to reduced output from several countries, impacting overall global supply. This situation is exacerbated by logistical challenges in transporting crude oil to refineries, further straining the availability of physical barrels in the market.</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Demand & Products**

Today's market tone is primarily influenced by gasoline demand, which remains robust amid ongoing consumer activity. Recent data indicates a steady increase in gasoline consumption, supported by lower retail prices that have encouraged driving. This uptick in demand is reflected in the tightening of gasoline inventories, which have seen a notable draw in recent weeks.

In contrast, diesel demand appears to be lagging, with inventory levels remaining relatively stable and showing less volatility compared to gasoline. Jet fuel demand is also experiencing a gradual recovery, but it does not currently exert the same influence on market sentiment as gasoline. Overall, the strong performance of gasoline is the key driver in today's market dynamics, overshadowing the more subdued signals from diesel and jet fuel.</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Regulatory & Geopolitical**

1. **U.S. Sanctions on Iranian Oil Exports**: The U.S. Treasury Department has announced new sanctions targeting entities involved in the sale of Iranian oil. This development could tighten global oil supply as it may deter buyers from engaging with Iranian crude, potentially leading to upward pressure on prices as markets adjust to a reduced availability of oil from this source.

2. **OPEC+ Production Adjustments**: OPEC+ has indicated discussions regarding potential adjustments to production quotas in response to recent price fluctuations. Should any changes be implemented, this could directly impact the volume of oil available in the market, influencing both pricing and flow dynamics, particularly if member countries decide to cut production to stabilize prices.

3. **Russia's Export Tax Changes**: Russia has announced a revision of its export tax on crude oil, which is set to increase. This could lead to higher prices for Russian crude on the international market, affecting flows as buyers reassess the cost-effectiveness of sourcing from Russia. The change may also prompt shifts in trade patterns as countries seek alternative suppliers to mitigate increased costs.</div>

            <div class="section-title">Key Decisions & Watchpoints</div>
            <div class="section-body">If geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions persist, then supply disruptions may lead to increased volatility in crude oil prices. If refinery utilization rates remain low due to maintenance activities, then product inventories could build, potentially exerting downward pressure on gasoline and diesel prices. If the current trend of rising U.S. oil production continues, then it may impact global oil supply dynamics and influence OPEC's production strategies.</div>
