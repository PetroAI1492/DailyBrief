            <div class="section-title">Executive Snapshot</div>
            <div class="section-body">In the last 24 hours, global crude markets exhibited a firmer tone, driven by ongoing geopolitical tensions and supply concerns in key producing regions. Notably, Brent crude has shown a divergence from West Texas Intermediate (WTI), with Brent moving upward while WTI remained relatively stable, reflecting differing regional dynamics and inventory levels.

Additionally, reports of production cuts from several OPEC+ members have contributed to the tightening of supply expectations, further supporting the upward momentum in Brent prices. Meanwhile, U.S. crude inventories reported a slight increase, which has tempered WTI's performance, highlighting the contrasting influences on the two benchmarks.</div>

            <div class="section-title">Market Signal</div>
            <div class="section-body">Over the last 24 hours, the physical market has exhibited tightening conditions, driven by a combination of reduced inventory levels and ongoing adherence to OPEC+ production cuts, which have reinforced a sense of scarcity in supply. This tightening has been reflected in the upward movement of crude prices, despite some divergence in refined product margins, where gasoline and diesel have shown varied responses to the crude price increase. The overall market sentiment remains focused on the implications of sustained OPEC+ discipline, which continues to support the bullish narrative in the crude sector. [TIGHTENING]</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Supply & Operations**

The most significant supply-side constraint currently affecting physical barrels is the ongoing maintenance and operational disruptions at key upstream facilities in the North Sea. Several major oil producers are conducting unplanned maintenance on offshore platforms, which has led to a notable reduction in crude oil output. This situation is compounded by logistical challenges in transporting the reduced volumes to market, further tightening supply. As a result, the overall availability of crude oil in the region is diminished, impacting both local and global supply dynamics.</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Demand & Products**

Today’s market tone is primarily influenced by gasoline demand, which has shown a notable increase in recent weeks. This uptick is attributed to rising consumer travel and activity levels, contributing to a tightening of gasoline supplies. 

In contrast, diesel demand remains relatively stable but does not exhibit the same upward momentum as gasoline. Jet fuel demand continues to recover, but it is not currently exerting significant pressure on the market compared to gasoline. Overall, the strong gasoline demand is the key driver shaping today’s market sentiment.</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Regulatory & Geopolitical**

1. **US-Iran Tensions**: The U.S. has imposed new sanctions on Iranian oil exports, targeting key shipping routes and companies involved in the transportation of Iranian crude. This development could disrupt the flow of oil from Iran, potentially tightening global supply and exerting upward pressure on prices, particularly if buyers seek to replace Iranian barrels with alternatives.

2. **OPEC+ Compliance Issues**: Reports indicate that some OPEC+ members are struggling to adhere to their production quotas, with notable non-compliance from certain countries. This could lead to an increase in overall oil supply in the market if these members ramp up production, impacting pricing dynamics. Conversely, if compliance improves, it may tighten supply and support higher prices.

3. **Russia's Export Tax Adjustments**: Russia has announced adjustments to its export tax on crude oil, which could influence the pricing of Russian barrels in international markets. A higher export tax may lead to reduced competitiveness of Russian oil, potentially decreasing its flow to key markets and affecting global pricing benchmarks as buyers seek more economically viable options.</div>

            <div class="section-title">Key Decisions & Watchpoints</div>
            <div class="section-body">If geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions persist, then supply disruptions may lead to increased volatility in crude oil prices. If refinery utilization rates remain low due to maintenance schedules, then refined product inventories may build, potentially exerting downward pressure on gasoline and diesel prices. If the current trend of rising U.S. oil production continues, then it may contribute to a shift in global supply dynamics, impacting OPEC's pricing strategies.</div>
