            <div class="section-body">In the last 24 hours, global crude markets exhibited a firmer tone, driven by ongoing geopolitical tensions and supply chain concerns. Brent crude and WTI benchmarks diverged, with Brent showing stronger gains compared to WTI, reflecting heightened demand signals in Europe amid supply uncertainties.

Additionally, market sentiment was bolstered by reports of reduced output from certain OPEC+ members, further tightening the supply landscape. This has contributed to a more bullish outlook for Brent, while WTI's performance remained comparatively muted, influenced by domestic inventory levels and refining capacity constraints.</div>

            <div class="section-body">Over the last 24 hours, the physical market has shown signs of tightening, driven by a combination of declining inventory levels and robust demand signals, which have supported upward price movements across various crude benchmarks. OPEC+ adherence to production cuts remains strong, further constraining supply and reinforcing the upward pressure on prices. While some regional benchmarks have diverged slightly due to localized factors, the overall market sentiment reflects a tightening condition as margins for refiners remain healthy, indicating sustained demand for refined products.

            <div class="section-body">**Supply & Operations**

The most significant supply-side constraint currently impacting physical barrels is the ongoing operational disruptions in upstream production due to geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions. Specifically, heightened instability in parts of the Middle East has led to intermittent outages and reduced output from several countries, which has created a tighter supply environment. This situation is compounded by logistical challenges in transporting crude oil to refineries, further straining the availability of physical barrels in the market. As a result, the upstream sector is facing increased pressure to maintain production levels amidst these challenges, directly influencing the overall supply dynamics.</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Demand & Products**

Today, the market tone is primarily influenced by gasoline demand. Recent data indicates a notable increase in gasoline consumption, driven by higher travel activity and a rebound in consumer mobility. This uptick has contributed to a tightening supply situation, supporting prices.

In contrast, diesel demand remains relatively stable but does not exhibit the same upward momentum as gasoline. Jet fuel demand continues to recover, but it is not currently exerting significant influence on the overall market tone. The strength in gasoline is thus the dominant signal, overshadowing the more subdued performance of other refined products.</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Regulatory & Geopolitical**

1. **U.S. Sanctions on Iranian Oil Exports**: The U.S. Treasury Department has announced new sanctions targeting Iranian oil exports, specifically aimed at entities involved in facilitating these shipments. This development could tighten global oil supply, particularly affecting flows from Iran, which has been attempting to increase its market share. As a result, prices may experience upward pressure due to concerns over reduced availability of Iranian crude in the market.

2. **OPEC+ Meeting Outcomes**: Following the recent OPEC+ meeting, member countries have reaffirmed their commitment to existing production cuts. This decision is likely to maintain current supply levels, potentially leading to a tightening of the market. As a consequence, physical oil flows may be constrained, and pricing could rise as market participants adjust to the sustained limitations on output.

3. **Political Unrest in Nigeria**: Reports of escalating political unrest in Nigeria, a key oil-producing nation, have emerged, with protests affecting operations in the Niger Delta region. Disruptions in production or transportation due to these protests could lead to a decrease in Nigerian crude exports. This situation may heighten concerns over supply disruptions, potentially driving up prices as buyers seek alternative sources to mitigate risks associated with Nigerian oil flows.</div>

            <div class="section-title">Key Decisions & Watchpoints</div>
            <div class="section-body">If geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions persist, then supply disruptions may lead to increased volatility in crude oil prices. If refinery utilization rates remain low due to maintenance schedules, then refined product inventories may build, potentially exerting downward pressure on gasoline prices. If global demand for petroleum products continues to show signs of recovery, then upward pressure on crude oil prices may intensify as market participants adjust their positions.</div>
