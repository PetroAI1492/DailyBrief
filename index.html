            <div class="section-body">In the last 24 hours, global crude markets exhibited a firmer tone, driven by renewed geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions. Brent crude showed a notable increase, diverging from West Texas Intermediate (WTI), which remained relatively stable amid ongoing inventory adjustments in the U.S. 

Market sentiment was further influenced by reports of production cuts from OPEC+ members, reinforcing bullish sentiment for Brent. Meanwhile, WTI's performance was tempered by rising U.S. crude stockpiles, leading to a clear divergence between the two benchmarks.</div>

            <div class="section-body">Over the last 24 hours, the physical market has exhibited tightening conditions, driven by a combination of declining inventories and sustained OPEC+ discipline, which has reinforced upward pressure on prices. While margins remain healthy, the overall demand for crude continues to outpace supply adjustments, leading to a notable draw in stock levels. Additionally, divergence in benchmark pricing has been observed, with certain regional grades experiencing sharper increases compared to others, reflecting localized supply constraints. This confluence of factors underscores a tightening market dynamic. [TIGHTENING]</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Supply & Operations**

The most significant supply-side constraint currently affecting physical barrels is the ongoing maintenance and operational challenges in upstream production facilities in the Gulf of Mexico. Recent reports indicate that several key offshore platforms are undergoing unplanned maintenance, leading to a temporary reduction in crude oil output. This situation is exacerbated by adverse weather conditions that have further complicated operations and logistics in the region. As a result, the overall production capacity has been impacted, contributing to tighter supply dynamics in the short term.</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Demand & Products**

Today’s market tone is primarily influenced by gasoline demand, which has shown a notable increase in recent days. This uptick is attributed to higher consumption rates as driving activity remains robust. Gasoline inventories have tightened, contributing to upward pressure on prices.

In contrast, diesel demand appears to be softer, with inventory levels remaining relatively stable. This divergence in product performance highlights the strength of gasoline relative to diesel in the current market landscape. Jet fuel demand remains steady, but it is not exerting a significant influence on the overall market tone today.</div>

            <div class="section-body">**Regulatory & Geopolitical**

1. **U.S. Sanctions on Iranian Oil**: The U.S. Treasury Department announced new sanctions targeting Iranian oil exports, specifically targeting entities involved in the sale and transportation of Iranian crude. This development could tighten global oil supply further, potentially leading to increased prices as buyers may seek alternative sources to mitigate risks associated with purchasing Iranian oil.

2. **OPEC+ Production Discussions**: Reports indicate that OPEC+ is considering adjustments to its production quotas in response to fluctuating global demand and rising inventory levels. Any decision to cut production could lead to a tightening of supply in the market, which may support higher crude prices and influence the flow of oil from member countries.

3. **Political Unrest in Nigeria**: Ongoing protests in Nigeria have raised concerns about the stability of oil production in the region. With Nigeria being a significant oil exporter, any disruption in production due to civil unrest could lead to a decrease in available barrels on the market, potentially driving prices higher as buyers react to the risk of supply shortages.</div>

            <div class="section-title">Key Decisions & Watchpoints</div>
            <div class="section-body">If geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions persist, then supply disruptions may lead to increased volatility in crude oil prices. If refinery utilization rates remain low, then product inventories may build, potentially exerting downward pressure on gasoline and diesel prices. If global demand for petroleum products continues to show signs of recovery, then upward pressure on prices may emerge as market participants adjust their positions.</div>
