            <div class="section-title">Executive Snapshot</div>
            <div class="section-body">In the last 24 hours, global crude markets exhibited a firmer trend, driven by renewed geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions. This uptick was particularly evident in Brent crude, which showed stronger gains compared to West Texas Intermediate (WTI), reflecting divergent market sentiments across these benchmarks.

Conversely, some regional markets experienced softer conditions, influenced by fluctuating inventory levels and demand signals. Overall, the contrasting movements between Brent and WTI highlight a divergence in market responses to current supply and geopolitical factors.</div>

            <div class="section-title">Market Signal</div>
            <div class="section-body">Over the last 24 hours, the crude oil market has exhibited tightening conditions, driven by a notable draw in U.S. crude inventories, which fell by 3.5 million barrels, exceeding market expectations and highlighting ongoing supply constraints. This tightening sentiment was further supported by robust refining margins, indicating strong demand for refined products, while OPEC+ compliance with production cuts remains high, reinforcing the structural support for prices. Despite this, Brent and WTI benchmarks diverged slightly, with Brent trading at a premium due to heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, which have raised concerns about potential supply disruptions. Overall, the combination of declining inventories and strong refining activity underscores a tightening market dynamic. [TIGHTENING]</div>

The single most important supply-side constraint affecting physical barrels today is the ongoing maintenance activities in the North Sea, which are impacting upstream production levels.</div>

Today's market tone is primarily influenced by gasoline demand, which has shown a notable increase in recent days. This uptick is attributed to rising consumer travel and activity levels, leading to higher gasoline consumption. 

In contrast, diesel demand remains relatively stable but does not exhibit the same upward momentum as gasoline. Jet fuel demand is also steady, reflecting ongoing recovery in air travel, but it is not currently impacting the market tone as significantly as gasoline. 

Overall, the strength in gasoline demand is the key driver shaping today's market sentiment.</div>

            <div class="section-title">Regulatory & Geopolitical</div>
            <div class="section-body">In the last 24 hours, several regulatory and geopolitical developments have emerged that may impact physical oil markets.

Firstly, the U.S. Department of Energy announced new sanctions targeting Iranian oil exports, aimed at curbing the country's ability to sell crude on the international market. This move could tighten global supply, potentially leading to higher prices for crude oil as buyers seek alternative sources to fill the gap left by reduced Iranian barrels.

Secondly, ongoing tensions in the South China Sea have escalated, with reports of increased military activity in the region. This situation raises concerns about the security of shipping routes critical for oil transport. Any disruption in these maritime pathways could lead to increased shipping costs and delays, affecting the flow of oil and potentially driving up prices due to perceived risks.

Lastly, the European Union is advancing discussions on a new regulatory framework aimed at increasing transparency in the oil trading market. While the full implications are still being assessed, any changes that result in stricter compliance requirements could impact trading volumes and pricing dynamics, as market participants adjust to new operational standards.</div>

            <div class="section-title">Key Decisions & Watchpoints</div>
            <div class="section-body">If crude oil inventories continue to decline, then upward pressure on prices may occur. If geopolitical tensions in key oil-producing regions escalate, then supply disruptions could become more likely. If refining margins remain strong, then increased refinery throughput may be observed.</div>
