Petroleum Morning Brief

Petroleum Morning Brief is a daily executive intelligence note that distills the most important price, margin, inventory, and flow signals across the petroleum market into a single, readable page.

It is designed for decision-makers, not traders chasing ticks and not analysts buried in spreadsheets.

Purpose

The brief answers one core question every morning:

“What changed, why does it matter, and what should I be watching today?”

It does not forecast prices or offer investment advice.
It provides situational awareness grounded in observable market data.

Scope

The brief focuses on:

Crude benchmarks (WTI, Brent)

Refining margins and product cracks

Physical inventory signals (EIA, when current)

Demand and product flows

Operational and geopolitical context

Data confidence and visibility

Coverage emphasizes the last 24 hours, with explicit notation when data is stale or incomplete.

Editorial Principles

Observational, not predictive

Signal over noise

Clarity over volume

Explicit uncertainty when data is incomplete

No hype, no narratives detached from data

If data quality is limited, the brief says so.
